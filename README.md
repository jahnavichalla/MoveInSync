# Market Segmentation Prediction Using Machine Learning
## Project Description
This project predicts the appropriate customer segment for new market customers based on their demographics and behavioral data. Using machine learning, we classify customers into four segments: A, B, C, and D, helping businesses target their marketing strategies effectively. The dataset consists of features such as age, work experience, spending score, and family size.




## File Descriptions
- `train2.csv`: Training dataset with customer features and segmentation labels.
- `test2.csv`: Test dataset with customer features only.
- `main.ipynb`: Jupyter Notebook containing the code for preprocessing, modeling, and predictions.
- `README.md`: This file, providing an overview of the project.
- `test_data_with_predictions`: Output file with predicted customer segments for the test dataset.


## How to Use
1. Open `main.ipynb` in Jupyter Notebook or any Python IDE.
2. Before running the code, ensure you have the dataset files (`train2.csv` and `test2.csv`) in your desired location.
3. Run all cells to train the model and generate predictions for the test data.
4. Check the predictions in `test_predictions.csv`.
